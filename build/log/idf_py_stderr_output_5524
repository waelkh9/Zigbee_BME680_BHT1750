CMake Error at D:/Users/waelk/v5.2.1/esp-idf/tools/cmake/build.cmake:544 (message):
  WARNING: 3 unexpected files and directories were found in the
  "managed_components" directory: bme680 esp_idf_lib_helpers i2cdev

  Content of the managed components directory is managed automatically and
  it's not recommended to place any files there manually.  To suppress this
  warning set the environment variable:
  IGNORE_UNKNOWN_FILES_FOR_MANAGED_COMPONENTS=1

  ERROR:

          Some components (espressif/esp-zigbee-lib) in the "managed_components" directory were modified         on the disk since the last run of the CMake. Content of this directory is managed automatically.

  

          If you want to keep the changes, you can move the directory with the component to the "components"         directory of your project.

  

          I.E. for "espressif__esp-zigbee-lib" run:
          mv C:\Users\waelk\zigbee_test\managed_components\espressif__esp-zigbee-lib C:\Users\waelk\zigbee_test\components\espressif__esp-zigbee-lib

  

          Or, if you want to discard the changes remove the ".component_hash" file from the component's directory.

  

          I.E. for "espressif__esp-zigbee-lib" run:
          rm C:\Users\waelk\zigbee_test\managed_components\espressif__esp-zigbee-lib\.component_hash
